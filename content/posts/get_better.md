# Get Better

Lack of skill, a lot of times show a lack of confidence in diving into the unknown, unwilling to be uncomfortable for a long period of time, unable to feel dumb for a while.

a lot of people have been too comfortable in their life for a very long time.
we have been aforded a lot of convincies through out the years, as humanity gets to evolve and we have got really lazy, **Specially Mentally**

A lot of us want to be happy, comfortable, intent. We don't even want to strive for improvements, don't tell me you want to achieve greatness, if you are not going to challenge yourself, your life, your confidence, your mental and physical state, your habits. If you are not going to challenge that for very long time, stop telling lies to people and yourself, that you are going to get better, because your actions say differerent.
