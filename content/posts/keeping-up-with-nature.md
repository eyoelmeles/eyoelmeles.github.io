How does light move?

does light follows the shortest path?
a good example to support this could be, if light reflects on a water body, the angle of incident is equal to the angle of reflection.

but when light changes medium it refracts, it doesn't keep the straight line, or follow the shortest path.

Snell's Law: says the defraction can be calculated usinng the sine angle of the first medium devided by the sine angle of the second medium

then Pierre Fermat comes up with the idea that light is not picking the shortest path, but rather the quickest path, particularly for the different medium he wanted to prove that the defraction angles are saving time rather than distance travelled.
