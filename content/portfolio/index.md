## Work Experience

### Top Link Technologies, TLT Ethiopis PLC(Feb.2022 - Nov.2023)

_Senior Software Engineer_

Created a very big ERP project for the Ethiopian government. The project was a success and it is still being used by the government. I led a squad, and worked on both the backend and frontend part of the project. Mainly focusing on the frontend, using React and Redux with typescript, and tailwindcss abstractions, for the backend, mainly helping the DevOPS to deploy .NET microservices.
